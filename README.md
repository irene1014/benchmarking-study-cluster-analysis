# benchmarking-study-clustering-analysis

This code is part of a a paper selected for presentation in the IFCS 2019 Cluster Benchmarking Challenge.
The goal of the study is to investigate how Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), 
and Spectral Clustering perform on simulated and real data sets with different characteristics. 
We also compare their performance with one of the most common and simple clustering techniques, k-means.
