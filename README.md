# benchmarking-study-clustering-analysis

This code is part of a paper selected for presentation in the IFCS 2019 Cluster Benchmarking Challenge (https://ifcs.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Second_call_challenge3.pdf).
The goal of the study is to investigate how Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) 
and Spectral Clustering perform on simulated and real data sets with different characteristics. 
We also compare their performances with one of the most common and simple clustering techniques, k-means.

We work with a five simulated and three real datasets. Each R file in the repository contains our code for running the three clustering methods on one dataset. The R files corresponding to the five simulated datasets are: multishapes_Rcode, spiral_Rcode, gaussian_distributions_Rcode, mixed_distributions_1_Rcode, and mixed_distributions_2_Rcode. The R files and respective RData files corresponding to the three simulated datasets are: bike_data_RCode (customerTrends.RData), forest_fire_RCode (forestfire.RData), and airbnb_RCode (santaClaraAirbnb.RData).
